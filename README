Lytton WW. Adapting a feedforward heteroassociative network to
Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics.  J Computational Neuroscience, 5:353--364, 1998.

At launch this example quantitatively reproduces figure 5 of the paper.
The window appearance is shown in fig5.gif.

For questions about the model contact Bill Lytton at

NB: program uses SNS synaptic formalism that predates NetCon.
Also it supplies its own standard run library so Graphs
from the NEURONMainMenu will not work. Run different
patterns with
	show(2)
where the 2 may be replaced by an integer in the range from 0 to 59.
The results of each run will be displayed in the tray after the run.

The 'WARNING nsyn==0' messages are irrelevant for this example.

Some non-substantive changes to the original code were made by Michael Hines
to allow it to run on mswin and mac os. Under mswin, this model can only
be run using NEURON version 5.2 2002/02/28 or later since it makes use of
calls to sprintf and hoc_obj_file_arg which were not exported by earlier
versions. On a MAC you may need to increase the memory size for NEURON
to 24MB.

Changelog
---------
2022-05: Updated MOD files to contain valid C++ and be compatible with the
         upcoming versions 8.2 and 9.0 of NEURON.
